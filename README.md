# 🧭 Disk Usage Visualizer

A **cross-platform desktop application** built in **Rust** that scans directories, visualizes disk usage, detects duplicate files, and lets users manage (delete, move, or duplicate) their files — all through a clean **Iced GUI** interface.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📁 **Folder Scanning:**
  Recursively scans directories to calculate file and folder sizes.

*  **Disk Visualization:**
  Displays top files and folders using progress bars for intuitive size comparison.

*  **Duplicate Detection:**
  Uses cryptographic hashing (**BLAKE3**) to identify identical files even if they have different names.

*  **Safe File Management:**
  Delete, move, or make copies of files directly from the interface — safely moves deleted files to the system trash instead of permanent deletion.

*  **Native File Picker:**
  Integrated native folder selection dialogs via **rfd** for a smooth, OS-consistent user experience.

*  **Asynchronous Scanning:**
  Uses asynchronous operations to prevent UI blocking while scanning large directories.
